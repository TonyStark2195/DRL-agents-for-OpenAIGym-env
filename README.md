DRL agents for OpenAIGym environments:
- Developed Deep Reinforcement Learnig agents (DQN, DDPG, DeepSARSA, PPO) for OpenAI simulator and Mujoco-Py environments
- Conducted extensive analysis on performance of the above algorithms on each of the environments

Python Packages used: **OpenAI Gym, Keras, Keras-RL, Tensorflow, TensorBoard, Matplotlib, Numpy, Mujoco-py (simulator and python interface)** \
Other technologies involved: **Linux, Google CoLab, GPU**
